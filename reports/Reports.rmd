# Introduction
Online learning platforms are getting popularity day by day and hence, generating tons of data. This data can be used to help the course or the platform to grow and gain more traction by improving the course even further. So, in this report we will try to answer questions like, which device learners use more often to access the content, from which region more learners are taking up the course, over the various iterations of the course, number of enrolled learners are increasing or decreasing.

### Which device is being mostly used to access the content?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Most widely used device to access the data"}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/DataScience/R/CSC8631_Data_Management/Cyber-Security-Data-Analysis/graphs/1.png")
