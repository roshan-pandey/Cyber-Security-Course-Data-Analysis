# Cyber-Security-Data-Analysis

## 1. Introduction
Online learning platforms are getting popularity day by day and hence, generating tons of data and we all know data is the fuel for today's world. We can leverage this data to it's true potential to help the course or the platform to grow and gain more traction by improving the course even further. So, in this report we will try to answer questions like, which device learners use frequently to access the content, from which region more learners are taking up the course, over the various iterations of the course number of enrolled learners are increasing or decreasing.

## 2. Objective
There are mainly two objectives for this analysis:

2.1. Target Right Audience.

> We want to know from which **location** mostly people are enrolling for the course, what are their employment background and status, their age range etc. This will allow the course provider to target right audience. First, we will try to analyze which continent has most enrolled learners, then we will pin point the country. This way it will be easy to target right locations with precision for advertisement. After this, analysis will be done on learners gender, age range, heights education quaification, employment area and status to understand better which type of people are showing keen interest in the course and hence, personalized ads can be pushed to the right audience.

2.2. Course Improvement.

> Once right audience has been singled out, course can be improved to make it more appealing to the potential learers. This can be done in various ways such as, analysing which type of devices (**Desktop, Mobile Phone, Tablet**) are being used most often than others, is there any trend in usability of a particular device over different runs of the course. Analysis can also be done on sentiments of the learners who have taken the course in the past and peaking into the reasons why they chose to leave the course.
